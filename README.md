# Restaurant Review App

## Instructions to load the online app
* Download the Restaurant-Review-App repository from Github to the local PC
* Unzip the file
* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000` (or some other port, if port 3000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 3000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
* After starting the localhost server, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`
* The app will load
